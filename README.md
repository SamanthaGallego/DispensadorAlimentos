# Smart Pet Feeder

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Pet Feeder project, where we've developed an innovative solution to simplify and enhance the feeding routine for your beloved pets. Our system seamlessly integrates hardware and software, providing you with a smart and automated pet feeding experience.

## Project Overview

The Smart Pet Feeder is designed to offer convenience and customization, allowing you to feed your pets on a schedule or remotely through a user-friendly web interface. The project consists of two main components:

1. **Hardware Dispenser:**
   - The dispenser is equipped with smart technology to accurately measure and dispense pet food.
   - It ensures precise portion control, catering to the dietary needs of different pets.

2. **Software Interface:**
   - The web interface provides a centralized platform for users to interact with the Smart Pet Feeder.
   - Users can set feeding schedules, monitor dispensing activities, and make adjustments in real-time.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the feeder up and running on your local machine:
